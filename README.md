# unsupervised-pokemon
A quick foray into unsupervised learning using Pokemon data. The data was sourced from https://www.kaggle.com/mariotormo/complete-pokemon-dataset-updated-090420?select=pokedex_%28Update_04.21%29.csv, so a big thanks to Mario for making this publicly available!

My goal with this project was to see if I could use some unsupervised learning methods to sort Pokemon into different "categories" (i.e. are some 'tanks' v. 'brawlers' v. 'something entirely different'). 

A quick summary of the .py files available here:
* 'Pokemon_clean.py' is the one I recommend actually using since it's the one I made the most effort to be intelligible.
* 'Pokemon_Exploratory.py' is really me just getting to know the data and understand what is available
* 'Pokemon_ML.py' is just a bunch of different models thrown at the wall to see what sticks
* 'Pokemon_UpperTier.py' is where things started to get interesting, so much of what you'll see here is a messier version of what's in Pokemon_clean

Again Pokemon_clean is really the one I recommend looking at since the others are really more of my top of mind thoughts and instincts as I followed my nose through the data. Some of it ended up being cool, some of it ended up being nonsense -- so if you get confused while reading through the other files, you've been warned!
